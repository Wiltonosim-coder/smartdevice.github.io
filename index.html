								<h2>Recommendations</h2>
								<p>I have always known that Wilton would go beyond the laboratory research experience because of his curiosity and inert ability to find something new from seemingly neglected points that has direct impact on the wellbeing of mankind- economically, socially or otherwise. 
									His quest for learning and desire to add value has been a major catalyst to his evolvement into a data analyst. He finds joy and strength in unraveling hidden stories behind data sets. His critical thinking is sophisticated and his analytical depth, demonstrated in the articles and scientific journals he has published, is worthy of note. </p>
									<p>.....Prince Hippolytus Oluoha,
										BEng, MSc. Cyber Security - London, UK</p>
										<p>Having worked personally and published research papers with Dr. Osim, he has consistently outperformed his peers. To think that Wilton won’t do more than laboratory research is an expensive oversight of his relentless and daunting determination to positively contribute to humanity in ways that has direct impact on their lives. I believe that Wilton’s passion for data analytics is a testament of his quest for significance beyond success. 
											He always engages in courses that impact lives directly. Although I didn’t see this coming truly, but I’m not surprised because he has proved over the years to always go for more. He is a deep thinker, open-minded, analytical and detailed. These intrinsic qualities - which are necessary components and building blocks of data analysts, would give him an edge.
