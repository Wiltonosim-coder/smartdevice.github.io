								<h3>why data</h3>
								<p>I am a passionate data analyst that is interested in extracting hidden stories in data sets. I believe that every data set houses an enormous quantum of information that can influence, to a quantitative degree, ground-breaking business decisions when acted upon. This undeniable truth fueled my decision to embark on this exciting journey of data analytics. My deepest desire is to help businesses uncover trends hidden in the life of the business (data), make recommendations based on those discoveries in an attempt to engineer business decisions for growth and maximization of profit.

								<h4>my journey into the world of data</h4>
								<p>My journey into the world of data analytics began in 2020. Even though my work life revolved around laboratory research, I never lost sight of my desire to make significant contributions to the development and growth of any company beyond the laboratory experience. As a trained scientific researcher, I have carried out novel researches, published my findings and also presented my work in conferences around the world but that was how far it got. Just discovering and publishing results without any direct economic impact wasn’t enough for me. This lack of satisfaction redirected my attention to something more – data!</p>

								<p>I believe that my research experiences not only opened me up to the amazing revelations masked behind data sets, but also pointed me to the major drivers of business growth. This created an obsession within me and has given me the courage to dive completely into the world of data analytics.</p>

								<p>As an entry-level data analyst, I am seeking opprotunities where my acquired skills can be applied to add value </p>
